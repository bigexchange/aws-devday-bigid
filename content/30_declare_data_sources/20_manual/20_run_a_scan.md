Then, expand the Scan Profile section

### Start a scan
Once you have expanded the Scan Profiles section, you can start a scan.
In this example, we will select the already existing "Full Data Source Scan".
You can create your own scan profile to create tailor made scanning activity, both in terms of scanning type and data source.
